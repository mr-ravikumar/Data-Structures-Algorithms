Flowcharts are graphical representations of algorithms or processes. They use standardized symbols to illustrate the flow of control within a program or system. In C++ programming, flowcharts are often used to plan and visualize the logical structure of code before implementation. Here's a theoretical overview of flowcharts in the context of C++ programming:

Basic Symbols:

Start/End Symbol: Denotes the beginning or end of the flowchart.

Input/Output Symbol: Represents input from the user or output to the user.

Process Symbol: Represents processing or computation.

Decision Symbol: Represents a decision point in the flowchart, typically based on a condition. It has two or more possible paths (yes/no or true/false).

Connector Symbol: Connects different parts of the flowchart.

Subroutine Symbol: Represents a call to a subroutine or function.

Flow Lines: Arrows that indicate the flow of control from one symbol to another.
