History:-

Origins in C: C++ evolved from the C programming language, which was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. C was widely used for system programming and became very popular due to its efficiency and flexibility.

C with Classes: In the late 1970s, Bjarne Stroustrup began working on what he called "C with Classes," which aimed to add support for object-oriented programming concepts to C. This effort eventually led to the creation of C++.

C++ Official Release: The first official release of C++ came in 1985. It introduced features such as classes, derived classes, constructors, and destructors. The language continued to evolve over the years with the addition of new features and improvements.

Standardization: C++ was standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1998, with the release of the C++98 standard. Subsequent revisions were made, leading to the development of the C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20 standards. These standards introduced significant enhancements to the language, including improved support for templates, concurrency, and more.
